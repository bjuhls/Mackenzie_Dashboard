aCDOM(254) (1/m);Yes;Yes;CDOM absorption at 254nm (m-1);measured with a spectrophotometer
DOC (mg/L);Yes;Yes;Dissolved organic carbon concentration (mg/L);DOC samples were filled into a pre-rinsed 20 mL glass vial and acidified with 25 uL HCl Suprapur (10 M) and stored in the dark at 4 °C. After transport DOC samples were analyzed at the Alfred Wegener Institute Potsdam Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) Germany. DOC concentrations were analyzed using high temperature catalytic oxidation (TOC-VCPH Shimadzu).

Al (Âµg/L);Yes;Yes;Aluminium (Âµg/L);The samples for Al were filtered through a 0.45 Âµm cellulose acetate filter and stored at the freezer (-21°C). Al concentrations were measured with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using Perkin-Elmer Optima 8300DV at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) Potsdam Germany.
