DOC (mg/L);Yes;Yes;Dissolved organic carbon concentration (mg/L);DOC samples were filled into a pre-rinsed 20 mL glass vial and acidified with 25 uL HCl Suprapur (10 M) and stored in the dark at 4degC. After transport DOC samples were analyzed at the Alfred Wegener Institute Potsdam Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) Germany. DOC concentrations were analyzed using high temperature catalytic oxidation (TOC-VCPH Shimadzu).
